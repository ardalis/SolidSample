# SOLID Principles for C# Developers

A sample application used to demonstrate *SOLID* principles.

## SOLID Principles

### SRP - Single Responsability

> A class or function should have one and only one reason to change. Has a *single responsability*.
> > See [SRP example here](./docs/SRP-README.md).

### OCP - Open- Close

> A class or function should be *Open* for extensions and *Closed* for modifications.
> See an [OCP example here](./docs/OCP-README.md).

### LSP - Liskov Substitution

> A subclass must be substitutable for their base types.
> See a [LSP example here](./docs/LSP-README.md).

### ISP - Interface Segregation

> A big interface should be *segregatted* in small ones. A class that implements an interface should not be force to implement methods it don't use.
> > See an [ISP example here](./docs/ISP-README.md).

### DIP - Dependency Inversion

> High-level modules(business or domain modules) should not depend on low-level modules(logging or file system modules). Both should depend on abstractions.
> See a [DI example here](./docs/DI-README.md).

## Initial repository- ARDALIS

The `master` branch shows the *initial* code used in the course. It's the starting point. If you want to follow along, you can Fork this repository or download a ZIP with the code. There are separate tags (and branches for that matter) for each of the 5 principles that you can review or download as well. Here are links you can use to jump to these tagged versions in your browser:
